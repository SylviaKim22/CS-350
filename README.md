SingleByte Project:
The main objective of this project was to utilize a single byte stored in a serial buffer. The characters entered by the user were iterated through a switch/case construct, enabling them to input either 'on' or 'off' into the terminal. The LED on the board was controlled based on whether the user typed 'on' or 'off', resulting in the corresponding action.
I am pleased with my performance in implementing the switch/case construct, particularly considering that it was my first genuine attempt at utilizing it. Although it required some experimentation and refinement, the end result was highly satisfactory and well-organized.
There are areas where I can strive for improvement. One such area is simplifying the code further by incorporating the inputs directly into the transition arc instead of utilizing if statements. This approach would contribute to a more streamlined and concise implementation.
I am gaining valuable experience in using Code Composer Studio (CCS) and programming microcontrollers (MCUs). Before this class, I had no prior experience with MCUs, so there was a significant learning curve involved. The knowledge and skills acquired through this project, as well as other projects, will serve as valuable references for future endeavors. It's great to have a collection of projects to look back on and reflect upon as I continue to grow and develop my expertise.
My proficiency in code structure and understanding of embedded systems will prove highly beneficial as I progress further. These skills will serve as a solid foundation for future endeavors and enable me to tackle more complex challenges effectively. The knowledge gained in these areas will be instrumental in my ongoing development and success.
While I occasionally tend to overthink solutions, I make a conscious effort to maintain clean and easily understandable code whenever feasible. This particular code can be easily modified by adding or removing cases within the switch/case construct to adjust the desired output. This flexibility allows for straightforward customization without major alterations to the overall structure.

Thermostat Project
This project effectively utilizes a wide range of built-in peripherals on the board, consolidating various concepts covered in the class while incorporating new information. The primary objective was to develop a functional thermostat by integrating the code and functionality of the board. In this setup, changes in temperature detected by the on-board sensor trigger the activation of an LED and result in the modification of a value, emulating the behavior of a heater turning on. This comprehensive project successfully combines hardware and software elements to achieve the desired thermostat functionality.
After extensive troubleshooting and experimentation with various approaches, I am satisfied with the structure of the code and the variables I created. The code is clear, well-commented, and easy to follow. The variables are appropriately named and serve their intended purpose, making the code more comprehensible and maintainable. Overall, I am confident in the quality and organization of the code I have developed.
As previously mentioned, I acknowledge that my tendency to overthink solutions has occasionally resulted in rewriting this program multiple times. This experience has highlighted the importance of finding a balance between thorough analysis and efficient decision-making. Additionally, I recognize the need to enhance my understanding of how specific peripherals can be effectively coded. By further exploring and studying these peripherals, I can broaden my knowledge and improve my ability to utilize them in future projects.
I greatly appreciated the insightful discussions on the importance of asking questions and seeking clarification regarding the project. The posts and interactions provided valuable insights that significantly contributed to my understanding of the assignment. Recognizing the value of asking questions extends beyond the classroom setting, as it also emphasizes the significance of engaging with professors to clarify doubts and gain further clarity. Additionally, I acknowledge the benefits of exchanging ideas and questions with peers, as this collaborative approach fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Furthermore, I found that reading the header files of the drivers utilized in the project proved to be extremely beneficial, as it provided valuable information and guidance for effectively utilizing those drivers.
Witnessing the interaction between the sensor on the board, the changing output in the terminal, and the corresponding LED behavior was truly exhilarating. It was captivating to observe all these components seamlessly integrate and operate as intended. Throughout the project, I gained a deeper understanding of coding peripherals to collaborate harmoniously. Specifically, I became proficient in combining button presses with custom variables, leveraging their functionality in conjunction with the temperature sensor. This comprehensive experience illuminated the intricate process of orchestrating different elements to achieve a cohesive and functional system.
The code in this project is exceptionally well-organized and straightforward to comprehend. I meticulously included numerous comments to elucidate the purpose of each line of code, variable, and functionality. By maintaining logical structuring, the code exhibits a coherent flow throughout. The while loop effectively demonstrates the functionality of each timer check, and its flexibility allows for easy modifications and expansions. Adding additional tasks, adjusting timings, or modifying default values would require minimal effort due to the code's adaptable design.
